# JS-Project (Gorillas)

## Background
Hi! This project is a projectile motion game invlolving two gorillas. One gorilla is controlled by the user and the other by the computer/AI. The goal of the game is to throw bananas and hit the other gorilla at the other end of the screen. The banana follows a projectile motion pattern, and the user decides the direction and speed of the banana thrown via two seperate gauges. Between the two gorillas, a jungle landscape is randomly generated. The user and AI gorilla have to throw the banana in a path avoid this landscape. Each time a gorilla is hit by a banana their lives decrease by one, and the game is concluded when either gorilla's lives drop to zero.
